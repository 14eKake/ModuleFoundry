# Simple System

This is a minimal skeleton for a Foundry VTT game system.

It now includes basic components for a simple wargame. The system defines three
actor types (`infantry`, `cavalry`, and `artillery`) which each track movement,
attack and defense values.

## Structure

- `system.json` - System manifest.
- `lang/` - Localization files.
- `templates/` - Handlebar templates.
- `template.json` - Default statistics for actor types.
- `scripts/` - System JavaScript.
- `styles/` - System CSS.

Modify these files to begin developing your own system.
